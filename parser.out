Rule 0     S' -> rule
Rule 1     rule -> TURN action DEVICE IF CONDITION
Rule 2     action -> ON
Rule 3     action -> OFF

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CONDITION            : 1
DEVICE               : 1
IF                   : 1
OFF                  : 3
ON                   : 2
TURN                 : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

action               : 1
rule                 : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . rule
    (1) rule -> . TURN action DEVICE IF CONDITION

    TURN            shift and go to state 2

    rule                           shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> rule .



state 2

    (1) rule -> TURN . action DEVICE IF CONDITION
    (2) action -> . ON
    (3) action -> . OFF

    ON              shift and go to state 4
    OFF             shift and go to state 5

    action                         shift and go to state 3

state 3

    (1) rule -> TURN action . DEVICE IF CONDITION

    DEVICE          shift and go to state 6


state 4

    (2) action -> ON .

    DEVICE          reduce using rule 2 (action -> ON .)


state 5

    (3) action -> OFF .

    DEVICE          reduce using rule 3 (action -> OFF .)


state 6

    (1) rule -> TURN action DEVICE . IF CONDITION

    IF              shift and go to state 7


state 7

    (1) rule -> TURN action DEVICE IF . CONDITION

    CONDITION       shift and go to state 8


state 8

    (1) rule -> TURN action DEVICE IF CONDITION .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (rule -> TURN action DEVICE IF CONDITION .)
